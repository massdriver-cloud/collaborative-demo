## AWS DynamoDB Table

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.

### Design Decisions

- **Billing Mode**: Depending on use-case, the billing mode can be set to either `PROVISIONED` or `PAY_PER_REQUEST`.
- **Capacity Management**: Auto-scaling policies and CloudWatch alarms are set up to monitor the read and write capacity usage.
- **Key Schema**: The table supports both simple and composite primary keys.
- **Global Secondary Indexes**: Allowed for faster retrieval of data based on alternate key definitions.
- **TTL**: Time-to-Live (TTL) attributes can be enabled for automated data expiry.
- **Streams**: If enabled, DynamoDB Streams capture data modification events in the table.

### Runbook

#### Checking Table Details

To view details of a specific DynamoDB table:

```sh
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name <table_name>
```

This command provides detailed information about the table, including its status, primary key schema, throughput settings, and more.

#### Monitoring Capacity Usage

For monitoring the read and write capacity units consumed and provisioned:

```sh
aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --metric-data-queries file://metric-queries.json
```

Save the following in `metric-queries.json` to query CloudWatch:

```json
{
    "MetricDataQueries": [
        {
            "Id": "readCapacity",
            "MetricStat": {
                "Metric": {
                    "Namespace": "AWS/DynamoDB",
                    "MetricName": "ConsumedReadCapacityUnits",
                    "Dimensions": [
                        {
                            "Name": "TableName",
                            "Value": "<table_name>"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "Period": 60,
                "Stat": "Sum"
            }
        },
        {
            "Id": "writeCapacity",
            "MetricStat": {
                "Metric": {
                    "Namespace": "AWS/DynamoDB",
                    "MetricName": "ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits",
                    "Dimensions": [
                        {
                            "Name": "TableName",
                            "Value": "<table_name>"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "Period": 60,
                "Stat": "Sum"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This will provide you with recent usage statistics of the specified DynamoDB table.

#### Alarming on Capacity Issues

If you have alarms set up for read or write capacity, you can describe them using:

```sh
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names <alarm_name>
```

This will provide the state and details of a given CloudWatch alarm.

#### Investigating Throttling

To investigate throttling issues, check the CloudWatch metrics for `ThrottledRequests`. Use the following command:

```sh
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/DynamoDB --metric-name ThrottledRequests --dimensions Name=TableName,Value=<table_name> --start-time <start_time> --end-time <end_time> --period 60 --statistics Sum
```

Set the `<start_time>` and `<end_time>` accordingly to get the data for the desired period.

#### Enabling TTL

To enable TTL on a DynamoDB table:

```sh
aws dynamodb update-time-to-live --table-name <table_name> --time-to-live-specification "Enabled=true, AttributeName=TTL"
```

This will automatically delete items based on the TTL attribute once the attributeâ€™s value is older than the current UNIX timestamp.

These commands will help you monitor and troubleshoot your AWS DynamoDB tables, ensuring they are running optimally and cost-efficiently.
